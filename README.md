Task: create an admission ticket sales terminal app for a museum

Sketch:

<img src="TicketSketch.jpg" />

The layout is designed for a touch screen. The museum employee will work from left to right.
- First choose an age category (other columns will be greyed out)
- second choose the right price (invalid options will be greyed out)
- third choose a number of tickets. I have a max of 5 (sketch has 10).

The total price should be updated in the right column.

The user can then add the tickets to the basket or checkout

***

Grid is now clickable

Removed basket - a bit too much for this assignment

JavaScript for calculations added

Added more CSS styling
Added response to "betalen" button

Possible future update (if time permits): basket!!
