Task: create an admission ticket sales terminal app for a museum

Sketch:

<img src="TicketSketch.jpg" />

The layout is designed for a touch screen. The museum employee will work from left to right.
- First choose an age category (other columns will be greyed out)
- second choose the right price (invalid options will be grayed out)
- third choose a number of tickets. I have a max of 5 (sketch has 10).

The total price should be updated in the right column.

The use can then add the tickets to the basket or checkout

To do:
* Build a grid with 4 columns as in the sketch. Basic styling only for testing purposes / Done. 
* Add CSS styling
* Add JavaScript for the calculations and responsive styling
