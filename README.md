Task: create an admission ticket sales terminal app for a museum

Sketch:

<img src="TicketSketch.jpg" />

The layout is designed for a touch screen. The museum employee will work from left to right.
- First choose an age category (other columns will be greyed out)
- second choose the right price (invalid options will be greyed out)
- third choose a number of tickets. I have a max of 5 (sketch has 10).

The total price should be updated in the right column.

The user can then add the tickets to the basket or checkout

Grid is now clickable

Removed basket - a bit too much for this assignment

To do: 
* Add more CSS styling
* Add JavaScript for the calculations and responsive styling
